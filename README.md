Steps Taken to Complete "QR code component" Challenge:

1. Recreated QR images in Figma: https://www.figma.com/design/d2alW0wMyNi0rRb5VXKEC5/juan-lab-3-2?node-id=0-1&m=dev
2. Note: ended up not using frame for Mobile. Only exported code (via Anima plugin) for Desktop frame from Figma to VS Code.
3. Spent much more time than I care to admit tinkering with the CSS file, while constantly checking the display for iPhone SE (dimensions 375) via DevTool's "Toggle Device Toolbar" option, where I can preview what the device would look like on mobile.

Quick reflection: I got stuck when my mind became married to the idea of getting Desktop to fix specifically to the iPhone SE dimensions, and had more success when I reset my thinking and prioritized simply making the divs responsive (Figma gave me all the dimensions fixed).

Note I: I have included in this file two images of how I "checked my work":
- QR_Code_Desktop_Screenshot.png
- QR_Code_Mobile_Screenshot.png

Note II: Will include answer to Reflection Questions in README file for repository to challenge 2/2.
